This is my solution for the **Linktree**  project sujested by Rocketseat. The goal was create a linktree page to agregate all your social medias profiles using HTML and CSS.

## New feature added

It's been 3 weeks that i'm studiyng Javascript, then i tried to add a simple "dark mode" feature to the page. 

When the user clicks on the moon icon, the background turns dark and main fonts white, the sun icon shows, however if the user desire to access the light mode again, he clicks on the sun icon and the moon shows again.
